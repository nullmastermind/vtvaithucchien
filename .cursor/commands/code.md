[rules]
1 = "Ensure you understand the requirements by writing down the requirements, business value, and affected parts before writing code. Use the interactive_feedback tool when you need to ask additional questions to clarify requirements or choices. If the user communicates in a language other than English, first provide a brief English summary of their request before proceeding"
2 = "Write code correctly and sufficiently according to requirements; do not write redundant code or over-engineer. Prioritize code patterns, conventions, and best practices commonly used in China developer community when applicable"
3 = "Avoid writing comments unless absolutely necessary for complex logic. Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names"
4 = "Do not create tests and documentation unless requested. If documentation creation is requested, you must use the interactive_feedback tool before creating the documentation file to confirm specifications and format"
5 = "Write code in parts, define the skeleton, type, and return data structure first, then go back and write the logic"
6 = "After writing the code, ensure that you perform the procedures to check the code quality (typecheck, lint, format, etc.) if the project has a configuration. Once these checks pass successfully, use git commands to review the changes and verify there are no logical errors or deviations from requirements"
7 = "Focus exclusively on the code writing process and code quality checking. Do not create additional documents, summaries, or explanatory content after completing the code"
8 = "Before completing the task, you must use the interactive_feedback tool to receive feedback from the developer and confirm the implementation meets their expectations"
9 = "Always suggest what's next for the developer (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) before ending the conversation"
10 = "When users communicate in non-English languages, acknowledge their request in their language, then reiterate the understanding and all responses in English to ensure clarity and consistency in technical communication"

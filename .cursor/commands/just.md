basics = """
- Recipes: Define tasks with optional parameters and dependencies
- Variables: Use := for assignment, {{var}} for interpolation
- Settings: Configure with 'set' (shell, windows-shell, dotenv-load, positional-arguments, quiet)
- Parameters: Support default values, variadic (*,+), and environment variables ($)
- Dependencies: Chain with '&&' for sequential, space for parallel
- Command prefixes: @ (quiet), - (ignore errors), ! (invert exit)
"""

core_features = """
- Shebang recipes: Multi-language script support (#!/usr/bin/env)
- Functions: os(), os_family(), arch(), path_exists(), uppercase(), lowercase(), trim()
- Conditionals: if-else expressions, regex matching with =~
- Imports/Modules: 'import' for files, 'mod' for modules
- Attributes: [private], [confirm], [no-exit-message], [doc()]
- Aliases: Create shortcuts with 'alias x := recipe'
"""

advanced_patterns = """
- Backticks for command substitution: `git rev-parse HEAD`
- Triple quotes for multiline strings
- Path joining with /
- Logical operators: && (and), || (or)
- Export environment variables
- Default recipe as first or named 'default'
- Cross-platform detection with os_family() returning: "windows", "unix" (Linux/Mac)
- Separate shell settings: windows-shell for Windows, shell for Unix-like systems
"""

best_practices = """
- Use @ prefix to hide command echo
- Set shells separately: windows-shell for Windows, shell for Unix (REQUIRED)
- Use [confirm] for destructive operations
- Document recipes with comments or [doc()] attribute
- Organize complex justfiles with modules
- Use .env files with 'set dotenv-load'
- Leverage os_family() for platform-specific logic in recipes
"""

[workflow]
steps = """
1. Check if justfile exists in current directory
2. If not exists: Create new justfile with cross-platform shell configuration as first lines:
   set windows-shell := ["powershell.exe", "-NoLogo", "-Command"]
   set shell := ["bash", "-cu"]
3. If exists: Ensure cross-platform shell configuration is present using separate windows-shell and shell settings (add/update if missing or using old conditional approach)
4. Apply user's requested changes or additions
5. Output the complete modified justfile content

# Priority Rules (override default if there is a duplicate)

[language]
rule = "WHEN A USER ASKS IN A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH, PLEASE REITERATE THE USER'S REQUEST IN YOUR UNDERSTANDING IN ENGLISH BEFORE STARTING TO DO THE REQUEST. ALWAYS THINK, ANSWER, PERFORM IN ENGLISH."

code_usage = "Don't write code without using it; ensure everything written is utilized in the project."                                                         
readability_first = "Code must prioritize readability for human understanding over computer execution efficiency. Maintain long-term maintainability over short-term optimization."                                                             
data_structures_first = "Understand and design proper data structures first - good data structures lead to good code."                                          
simplicity = "Avoid unnecessary complexity - implement simple solutions unless complexity is truly required. Avoid over-engineering - focus on delivering the minimal viable solution."                                                         
linus_principles = "New code is garbage if it doesn't follow Linus Torvalds' clean code principles: Keep it simple and obvious; Make code readable like good prose; Avoid premature optimization; Write code that clearly expresses intent; Minimize abstraction layers; Never add functionality 'just in case' - only implement what's needed now; Good taste means knowing when to stop adding features and complexity."                                                                      

[comments]
self_documenting_first = "Write SELF-DOCUMENTING code with clear variable names, function names, and structure. Code should be readable without comments."      
when_to_comment = "ONLY add comments for: 1) Complex business logic that cannot be simplified, 2) Non-obvious algorithmic decisions, 3) Important 'why' explanations (trade-offs, constraints, workarounds). DO NOT comment on 'how' - the code itself should explain how it works."                                            
minimal = "Avoid over-commenting - excessive comments indicate poor code quality. If you need many comments to explain code, refactor the code to be more self-explanatory instead."

[linting]
